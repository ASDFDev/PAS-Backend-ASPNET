## Running this software

Before running this software, ensure that you have **built** it first! See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for more info.

Currently I am using xsp4 to run this software, using Apache _IS_ possible. See [SetsunaOnApache.md](SetsunaOnApache.md) for more details

1. sudo apt install xsp4 / sudo dnf install xsp	
2. cd Setsuna
3. xsp4
4. open your browser and go to http://localhost:9000

_NOTE: xsp4 should only be used for debugging._
